# tetris-simple
A personal project of a tutorial nature; enclosed in this repository is my implementation of a simple Tetris program. It is was inspired largely by the tutorial created by Javier Lopez, originally released on December 14, 2008 at https://javilop.com/gamedev/tetris-tutorial-in-c-platform-independent-focused-in-game-logic-for-beginners/.
