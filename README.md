# tetris-simple

A personal project of a tutorial nature; enclosed in this repository is my implementation of a simple Tetris program. It is was inspired largely by the tutorial created by Javier LÃ³pez, originally released on December 14, 2008 at https://javilop.com/gamedev/tetris-tutorial-in-c-platform-independent-focused-in-game-logic-for-beginners/. As such, all work enclosed is under the Creative Commons (CC0 1.0 Universal) license.

I have made some changes from the original tutorial code, adding support for counterclockwise rotation of pieces. I intend to add more features, such as unique block coloring, menus, and a game score. 
All of the rendering for the game is done using SDL1.2, using rectangle primitives. I wanted to pursue this project because of my interest in game dev, and just because it's fun. Thanks, ciao!
